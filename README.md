### As a Data Analyst, I was tasked with answering the key business questions using the steps of the data analysis process:

- _Ask_ the right questions to help the company make data-driven decisions.
- _Prepare_ data by selecting and managing the appropriate dataset for the business task.
- _Process_ the data by cleaning ensuring data integrity.
- _Analyze_ the data through exploration, transformation, and chart visualization to make relevant insights.
- _Share_ the conclusions and interpreted the results with the stakeholders.
- _Act_ on the data by giving some recommendations.

### Business Questions:

- What are some trends in smart device usage?

- How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?

### Conclusion and Recommendations

After going through the 7 Analysis steps and despite the limitations of the Dataset (The data is from Fitbit and not Bellabeat and the sample size is small and for a limited number of time), I recommend the following for Bellabeat's marketing strategy:

1. More accurate data from Bellabeat users should be collected so that more accurate analysis can be generated.
2. To reduce the sedentary lifestyle of 81.3% of the users, and get more of them fairly or lightly active, a notification feature at a specific time to remind users could be added to the Bellabeat app.
3. Bellabeat can create group activities or content that encourages people to be more active on low-step and high-sedentary days like Sundays.
4. App notifications should be provided for users to remind them to get sufficient sleep every day and implement new sleep measurement features or products such as tracking sleep time and Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep.
5. Bellabeat can consider setting daily/weekly calorie challenges and award points to users based on the top performers. Where the points can be accumulated and redeemed as a discount for their next product purchase.
6. Bellabeat can suggest some ideas for low-calorie breakfast, lunch, and dinner foods to help users that want to lose weight.
7. Bellabeat marketing team can create campaigns, educational content, exercise suggestions and trackers on the Bellabeat app and host physical fitness events and activities.
8. The App should have a good user experience and should be seamless to use.
